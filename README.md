## 🙋‍♂️ About Me

I'm a passionate developer who recently completed **Web Development (MERN Stack)** from **Sheryians Coding School** and **Data Science with Python** from **CodeWithHarry**. Learning both JavaScript and Python at the same time was a challenge — but my **dedication never wavered**. With every error, I found new motivation, and my **curiosity keeps pushing me forward**.

🔭 Currently exploring the intersection of **AI and Web Development**\
🌱 Always learning new tools & tech to stay ahead\
